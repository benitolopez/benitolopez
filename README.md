## About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Benito Lopez! Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 10 years of experience and a solid background in both frontend and backend development. Iâ€™m passionate about solving problems and constantly learning. Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on various projects, from contributing to popular products to creating open source projects. I enjoy taking on challenges, developing custom features, and staying updated with the latest technologies.

## Technical Skills
- Programming Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, C, Go, Python

- Developer Tools: Command Line, Git, Docker
- WordPress: Core architecture, plugin/theme development, WooCommerce development, Block Editor (Gutenberg) development, REST API, etc
- Systems & Cloud Technologies: Linux, Apache, Nginx, Cloudflare, AWS

## Key Projects
- **[Uncode](https://undsgn.com/uncode):** Top seller WordPress theme (over 120,000 sales). I mainly deal with the backend, React (building components for the Block Editor) and the development of advanced and custom features for WooCommerce.
- **[WP Hotelier](https://wphotelier.com/):** A WordPress booking plugin for building hotel websites. It may be boring, but itâ€™s my first SaaS and itâ€™s growing, enough to pay my bills.
- **[Hotel Datepicker](https://github.com/benitolopez/hotel-datepicker):** A pure JavaScript date range picker for hotels or booking websites. It was tricky but fun to develop!
- **[ssnipp](https://github.com/benitolopez/ssnipp):** Minimalist and private code snippet sharer written in Go. I use it to share snippets with my clients.

## Professional Goals
- **Career Development:** Focused on advancing my career in software development by contributing to innovative projects that push boundaries and create significant positive change.
- **Continuous Learning:** Dedicated to constantly expanding my knowledge, even by exploring areas outside of my comfort zone, to stay at the forefront of technology and enhance my coding expertise.
- **Mathematics:** Passionate about deepening my understanding of mathematics (currently pursuing a degree part-time), particularly in areas that intersect with software development and AI.
