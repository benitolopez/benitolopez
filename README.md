I enjoy taking on challenges, developing custom features, and continuously learning new technologies.

## Key Projects
- **[Uncode](https://undsgn.com/uncode):** Top seller WordPress theme (over 120,000 sales). I mainly deal with the backend, React (building components for the Block Editor) and the development of advanced and custom features for WooCommerce.
- **[WP Hotelier](https://wphotelier.com/):** A WordPress booking plugin for building hotel websites. It may be boring, but itâ€™s my first SaaS and itâ€™s growing, enough to pay my bills.
- **[Hotel Datepicker](https://github.com/benitolopez/hotel-datepicker):** A pure JavaScript date range picker for hotels or booking websites. It was tricky but fun to develop!
